README for eyeZm iPhone App and ZoneMinder XML Plugin

This small installer package will install additional PHP scripts to your ZoneMinder
directory which will allow XML viewing of certain parts of your install. This is intended
for use with the eyeZm iPhone application, but can be used for other purposes as well.

-------------
Requirements:
-------------

- eyeZm 1.0+ for iOS 4 (http://www.eyezm.com)
- ZoneMinder 1.24.1 or 1.24.2
- FFMPEG, installed in a sensible place that is in your path (for event viewing)
- PHP enabled on your Apache server (which it probably is)
- Elevated/SUDO access. This script must be run with a user who can change permissions.

---------
Install:
---------

To install, simply type ./install as the right user. If on Ubuntu/Debian, sudo ./install works fine.

You must execute the installer with elevated permission, else you will see error messages.

------------------
eyeZm Performance:
------------------

Performance of the eyeZm application is heavily dependent on your network connection, as well as
ZoneMinder server speed.

Live Feed viewing, or viewing of events may take longer on 3G Networks due to bandwidth requirements.
If using eyeZm on WiFi, most of the time any performance issues are due to the speed of the ZoneMinder
server, and not the network.

-----------------
Potential Issues:
-----------------

After the above steps are completed, you should be able use the 'Test Connection' feature on the
eyeZm application to connect to your server. Use any alerted error messages, or the 'View Log' feature
of eyeZm to debug connection issues.

Once 'Test connection' passes, two potential issues that people have encountered are 1) Event Viewing
not working, and 2) Live feed doesn't update.

Issue 1: 

When clicking on an event to view in eyeZm, if you don't see any output after the 'Please Wait' disappears,
there is a chance that FFMPEG is not installed on your system correctly. Ensure that your Ffmpeg installation
is accessible in your path, and is executable by the username that Apache runs under. Please email support
(below) if you still have issues after verifying this.

Issue 2:

When trying to view a Live Feed of one of your monitors, if you see an initial image but it does not refresh
subsequently, there is a good chance that browser detection on your ZoneMinder installation is not patched
to work correctly.

See the following thread for the issue and fix: http://www.zoneminder.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=15429

This issue should get patched in future versions of ZoneMinder, and is not patched as part of the XML
plugin installation since it is out of it's scope.
