=head1 NAME

ZoneMinder::Config - ZoneMinder configuration module.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ZoneMinder::Config qw(:all);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ZoneMinder::Config module is used to import the ZoneMinder configuration from the database. It will do this at compile time in a BEGIN block and require access to the zm.conf file either in the current directory or in its defined location in order to determine database access details, configuration from this file will also be included. If the :all or :config tags are used then this configuration is exported into the namespace of the calling program or module.

Once the configuration has been imported then configuration variables are defined as constants and can be accessed directory by name, e.g.

 $lang = ZM_LANG_DEFAULT;

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
The :constants tag will export the ZM_PID constant which details the location of the zm.pid file
The :config tag will export all configuration from the database as well as any from the zm.conf file
The :all tag will export all above symbols.
