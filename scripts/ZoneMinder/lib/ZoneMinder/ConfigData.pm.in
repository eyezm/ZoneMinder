The timestamp used in both methods will contain the same time as this is preserved along with the image. The first method ensures that an image is timestamped regardless of any other circumstances but will result in all images being timestamped even those never saved or viewed. The second method necessitates that saved images are copied before being saved otherwise two timestamps perhaps at different scales may be applied.

If this option is set then a basic calculation is applied which though fast and fairly accurate can (due to rounding) mean that the actual range of pixel values in the reference image may be reduced from that in the captured image, e.g. a pixel may only be able to achieve a maximum of say 250 while the captured image is consistently at 255. If you also have a small minimum pixel difference threshold this can cause multiple bogus alarms.

This would sometimes have the undesirable side-effect of missing a chunk of the initial activity that caused the alarm because the pre-alarm frames would all have to be written to disk and the database before processing the next frame, leading to some delay between the first and second event frames. Setting this option enables a newer adaptive algorithm where the analysis daemon attempts to process as many captured frames as possible, only skipping frames when in danger of the capture daemon overwriting yet to be processed frames. This skip is variable depending on the size of the ring buffer and the amount of space left in it. Enabling this option will give you much better coverage of the beginning of alarms whilst biasing out any skipped frames towards the middle or end of the event. However you should be aware that this will have the effect of making the analysis daemon run somewhat behind the capture daemon during events and for particularly fast rates of capture it is possible for the adaptive algorithm to be overwhelmed and not have time to react to a rapid build up of pending frames and thus for a buffer overrun condition to occur.",

=head1 NAME

ZoneMinder::ConfigData - ZoneMinder Configuration Data module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ZoneMinder::ConfigData;
  use ZoneMinder::ConfigData qw(:all);

  loadConfigFromDB();
  saveConfigToDB();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ZoneMinder:ConfigData module contains the master definition of the ZoneMinder configuration options as well as helper methods. This module is intended for specialist confguration management and would not normally be used by end users.

The configuration held in this module, which was previously in zmconfig.pl, includes the name, default value, description, help text, type and category for each option, as well as a number of additional fields in a small number of cases.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item loadConfigFromDB ();

Loads existing configuration from the database (if any) and merges it with the definitions held in this module. This results in the merging of any new configuration and the removal of any deprecated configuration while preserving the existing values of every else.

=item saveConfigToDB ();

Saves configuration held in memory to the database. The act of loading and saving configuration is a convenient way to ensure that the configuration held in the database corresponds with the most recent definitions and that all components are using the same set of configuration.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
The :data tag will export the various configuration data structures
The :functions tag will export the helper functions.
The :all tag will export all above symbols.
