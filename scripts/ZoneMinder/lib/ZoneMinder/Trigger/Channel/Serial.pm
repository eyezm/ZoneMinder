# Below is stub documentation for your module. You'd better edit it!

=head1 NAME

ZoneMinder::Database - Perl extension for blah blah blah

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ZoneMinder::Database;
  blah blah blah

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Stub documentation for ZoneMinder, created by h2xs. It looks like the
author of the extension was negligent enough to leave the stub
unedited.

Blah blah blah.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.



=head1 SEE ALSO

related modules or operating system documentation (such as man pages
in UNIX), or any relevant external documentation such as RFCs or
