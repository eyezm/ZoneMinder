# Below is stub documentation for your module. You'd better edit it!

=head1 NAME

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ZoneMinder::Database;

unedited.

Blah blah blah.

None by default.



=head1 SEE ALSO

related modules or operating system documentation (such as man pages
in UNIX), or any relevant external documentation such as RFCs or
